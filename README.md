A repo of some code that I re-use in my projects.

A lot of my current work has to do with applying CNNs to videos, mainly for classification, but also for captioning, 
action localization, object tracking, and visual relationship detection. If you are working in the same field, some of
the code in pytorch_helpers/video_models might be of interest to you.
